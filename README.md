Deep Convolutional Network in Single Image Derain
==================================

## Overview
Restoring rain images is important for many computer vision applications in outdoor scenes since rain streaks can severely degrade the visibility causing many current computer vision algorithms fails to work.

In recent years, various methods mainly based on CNNs have been proposed to address this problem.

This repository records some papers with implementation and finally make comparison between them.
